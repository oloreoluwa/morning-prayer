    <p>Dear God, I ask for Your healing touch upon my health as we enter this new month. Strengthen my body, mind, and spirit. Protect me from illness and grant me the healing I need. Surround me with Your peace and comfort, and guide me in making choices that promote my well-being. May Your grace be evident in my health and recovery.<br> Enjoy Your Day‚ù§</p>
