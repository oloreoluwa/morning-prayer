  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <h2>Morning Prayer</h2>
    <p>Dear God, I ask for Your healing touch upon my health as we enter this new month. Strengthen my body, mind, and spirit. Protect me from illness and grant me the healing I need. Surround me with Your peace and comfort, and guide me in making choices that promote my well-being. May Your grace be evident in my health and recovery.</p>
